    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the website of Data-driven Innovation in MEdicine (DIME). Our research group aspires to improve people's lives through advancement in medicine harnessing data-driven innovation. We are based in Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, as part of the Usher Institute, Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh. Members of our group come from diverse backgrounds such as engineering, computer science, mathematics, and we enjoy strong collaborations, both in academia and industry from across the globe. 
    </p><p>   
        We work at the interface of engineering and medicine where we strive to address pressing challenges in medicine. Our core expertise stem from engineering and computer science (digital signal processing, machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence) but we enjoy strong, interdisciplinary collaborations that help us leverage our core expertise in addressing pressing challenges in healthcare.
    </p>
    <p>Our work has been published in several journals including The Lancet, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Nature Medicine, JMIR, IEEE Transactions, and Brain. To find more, click on relevant themes.</p>
